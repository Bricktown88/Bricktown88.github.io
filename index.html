            My name is Alex Young. This is my first homework assignment for the Coding Bootcamp hosted by the University of Kansas. I am looking forward to my journey of becoming a skilled web developer. I hate my code, don't look :D

            I grew up in Johnson County Kansas and graduated from the University of Kansas with a Finance degree back in 2011. After completing my degree, I developed the urge to see the world. Seemingly overnight, I found myself on a 16 hour plane ride to South Korea. I would end up spending the next three years of my life there teaching English. This was a tremendous life altering experience that I will skip over for the sake of time.

            I have a few major hobbies that dominate my free time. First and foremost, I am a hardcore computer gamer. I spent most of my young adult life attemping to "go pro" for a lack of a better word. I live much more of a balanced life now, but I still get my games in. My second hobby is golf. I have played my entire life and I'm pretty good. I currently love and live with my girlfriend of 6+ years, whom I met in Korea, and coincidentally.... we were neighbors in Lawrence, KS and never met until we were on the other side of the globe... small world.

            I will spruce up this summary when we work on this portfolio again later. Thank you for reading. Looking forward to the next 6 months!
